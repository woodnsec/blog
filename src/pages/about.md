## Hello

My name is Nate and I'm an information security analyst & engineer. In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family, working on my homelab, cycling, and camping.  I also enjoy working on [RedCTF](https://github.com/redctf/redctf) implementing Docker containers which scale and isolate users in a CTF. I've recently graduated from University of Nebraska Omaha with a MS in Cybersecurity. 

I'm also interested in expanding my SecDevOps and Security Engineering skill sets.
