###This serves as the initial blog post for woodnsec.com.  

I'm starting this blog to expand my knowledge of Gatsby.js, HTML, & CSS. It will host my resume, biography, and links to my external social medias and GitHub.  

This blog will be focused on security content including homelab, enterprise configuration and deployment for security tools and automation. Additionally it will serve as a link or feed from my other blog posts hosted at [0dayOmaha.com](https://0dayomaha.com) which is a WIP with Adam Schall [@clevernyyyy](https://twitter.com/clevernyyyy)
